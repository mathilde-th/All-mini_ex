My codinng process was a bit frustration. I tried for so long time to make it work, but it wouldn't work. I found the 3D box on references for p5.js, which I think was incredibly cool and nice that you can make so "advanced" expression with relatively easy coding.
But I could not make any text on the box, but a lot of help from the instructor we dicovered how. It was mega nice when it finally succeeded.

What a program constitutes I have no idea. 

An error for me is a flaw in the program and a failed task. An error has always been for me an unknown error in the program that you could not relate to because of lack of knowledge of software programming.
