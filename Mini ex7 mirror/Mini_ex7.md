Get Checked

My program was suposed to translate your movement recored by the webcam into checkboxes. In that way it was your movements
that created an interactive on/off checkbox that showed you translated from webcam, into pixels and then checkboxes. 
In that way, it would be interactive in another way than click with your mouse. 

I used a video made by Shiffman, but an error made it impossiple for me to solve, as you can see at the screenshot. I dont know how to
make it work, and I tried to google it, but with no help.


I really like the idea of transforming my understanding of an object from a created piece of code as a rect, ellipse, checkbox ect. Shiffman talked about a mirror that could make you a "live programmer" with your body, and change an object from a pre-code into a live object. (I know it is still pre-code, but  where it is checked and the movement of the checked checkbox is in this way totally "random" and unpredictable)

For me I understand a picture as an whole picture, and tend to forget it is only a lot of pixels showed with different colors that togehter creates a picture. With my code (if it worked) it shows how the computer sees a picture/image. By translating the pixels into checkboxes, that has the same color and acts the same way when it is activated, it shows how a picture/image is made, and it is our eyes and brain, that understands the checkboxes as a picture. The computer only sees it as 1000 of checkboxes randomly gets on and off.
