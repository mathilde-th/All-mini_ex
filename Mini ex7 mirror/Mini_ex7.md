Get Checked

My program was suposed to translate your movement recored by the webcam into checkboxes. In that way it was your movements
that created a interactive an on/off checkbox that showed you translated from webcam, into pixels and then checkboxes. 
In that way, it would be interactive in another way than click with your mouse. 

I used a video made by Shiffman, but an error made it impossiple for me to solve, as you can see at the screenshot. I dont know how
make it work, and I tried to google it, but with no help.
