I wanted to create a different throbber than you normally see on webpages. 
For me, a throbber is a circular animation moving around a center of a circle. 
My throbber is an animation based on a little fun. Everybody knows the figure Pacman, and I think it's an unexpected animation 
as a throbber. 
The dots is "moving" and that should tell the user, that the webpages is loading, and that there is something happining. 

First I made Pacman with opned mouth and the dots. Afterwards I creadted Pacman with closed mouth and som different dots.
I used a variable funktion to make the draw funktion chance between the to drawings of Pacman. (an if-funktion)
