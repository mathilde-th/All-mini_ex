  I created Daniel Schiffermans challange no. 15.
  My program is workning, but it is not doing, what i wanted and what it has to do.
  if you look at my sketch.js my code is exactely like Schiffermans. But My tree doesn't get the leaves after the 6 branch. 
  I do not understand why, and I have checked the code like 100 times.
