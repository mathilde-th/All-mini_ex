Title: I am a Flappy Bird

Selected Coding Challange: #31. Flappy Bird


- The added function is sound. I added the Flappy Bird song, that I found on YouTube. My intensions was some other functions.
  I really wanted to change the Bird, so everytime it hits a pipe, the bird will increase and be bigger, so the game would become
  more and more difficult. I tried and tried, but with no sucess. After that I tried to add a counter function, so you could see, how
  many pipes you managed to get throug. But agin I could make that work either.
  
- I think this mini_ex was very difficult. I tried to find som easier code in the Coding Challanges, because it was for me very difficult 
  to add functions, when her got 3 different "slides" with code working together. So to figure out where to change and add code was for me    
  difficult.
 
- The Flow chart is under the file Dokument1
  By using a Flow chart it becomes easier to show another person your way of building the code. For me it visualizes the use of 3 differnet sheets with code. It shows how the codes structure become very important for the whole program, and shows in my program for example that the game itself is very simple, but the code behind it is more complicated.
