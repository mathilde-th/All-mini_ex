I struggled so much with this mini ex. First I tried to make a program with an API from New York Times, but for me the code is more difficult than I though.
Then I tried to make the Weather Map with Shifmann, but an error kept getting in my way. 
2 students tried to help me to fix the error, but with no luck. I have uploaded 2 pictures of the webconsol that shows the error. 

I wanted to create a different interface to Shifmanns Weather Map, but with the "same code". But the error made in not possible for me to fix.
